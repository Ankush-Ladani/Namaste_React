// When you use a library, you are in charge of the flow of the application. You are choosing when and where to call the library. When you use a framework, the framework is in charge of the flow. It provides some places for you to plug in your code, but it calls the code you plugged in as needed.

// What is CDN? Why do we use it?

// In Normal script tag -> html parsing is stopped and script is fetched and executes and after that html parsing will be continue
// the script is downloaded asynchronously with the rest of the page without pausing the HTML parsing and the contents of the page are processed and displayed. OR downloads script asynchronously (stops HTML parsing) and executes script (stops HTML parsing)

// browser not to interfere with the HTML parsing and only to execute the script file once the HTML document has been fully parsed.
// downloads script asynchronously (stops HTML parsing) and executes script (after HTML parsing)
